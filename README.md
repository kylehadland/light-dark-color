# Light Dark Color Demo

Light and Dark modes are almost a necessity with current UI designs. Operating systems have it built in, web sites can even piggy back on this and automatically select the users system preference.

As we all know however, life is not black and white (or light and dark). I had an idea, I wanted to build something with a bold bright coloured background, but have the option to tone it down to suit the viewers preferences. I also wanted to make it simple to implement in any element, just like Tailwindcss dark mode functionality.

This is my answer.....
